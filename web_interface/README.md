This is a license plate detection model which can serve many purposes:
1-> tracking of stolen vehicles
2-> restrictions of particular vehicles

The model has been trained on YOLOv8 and the license plates are detected and traced using OCR which later checks databases and tells the status of the vehicle

This has been integrated with web interface and the trained files are already attached with python file
